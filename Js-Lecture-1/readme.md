Welcome to the journey of learning JavaScript! This repository kicks off with the classic "Hello World" program‚Äîyour first step into coding with JavaScript.


<p>Overview üöÄ
JavaScript is a powerful language used primarily in web development. In this lesson, we‚Äôll create a simple "Hello World" program, exploring the core syntax to get you comfortable with writing and understanding basic JavaScript code.</p>


Your First Program üíª
```bash
console.log('Hello, World!');
```
Breakdown:
1. console.log():
This function sends output to the browser's console. In our case, it will print out the text "Hello, World!". The console object represents the browser's console interface.

2. The String 'Hello, World!':
Anything enclosed in quotes is treated as a string. It‚Äôs just text that we want the program to display.

3. Semicolon ;:
While JavaScript doesn‚Äôt strictly require it, it's a good practice to end each statement with a semicolon to avoid bugs as your programs grow.


Comments üìù
Comments are used to explain what your code does or to temporarily disable code.

Single-line comment:
```
// This is a single-line comment
```
Multi-line comment:
```
/*
  This is a multi-line comment
*/
```

This is just the start. From here, you'll dive deeper into JavaScript, covering variables, loops, functions, and much more. Each lesson will build on this foundation, so get comfortable with the syntax!
